define Package/redsocks/description
  Redsocks is a daemon running on the local system, that will transparently
  tunnel any TCP connection via a remote SOCKS4, SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy server. It
  uses the system firewall's redirection facility to intercept TCP connections,
  thus the redirection is system-wide, with fine-grained control, and does
  not depend on LD_PRELOAD libraries.

  Redsocks supports tunneling TCP connections and UDP packets. It has
  authentication support for both, SOCKS and HTTP proxies.

  Also included is a small DNS server returning answers with the "truncated" flag
  set for any UDP query, forcing the resolver to use TCP.
